# next-boost

`next-boost` is a middleware which adds a disk cache layer to your SSR applications. It was built originally for `Next.js` SSR applications and can be used in any node.js `http.Server` based application.

```bash
$ npm install next-boost --save
```

## Features

- Drop-in replacement for Next.js's production mode: `next start`
- Greatly reducing the server TTFB (time-to-first-byte)
- Non-blocking main process for cache-serving and using `worker_threads` for SSR
- Simultaneous requests will be queued, where the first request will be rendered and the rest served by the cache
- By using a [database-disk-hybrid cache](https://github.com/rjyo/hybrid-disk-cache), `next-boost` has
    - no memory capacity limit, and works great on cheap VPSs
    - no need to add a cache layer server like varnish, nginx Cache and etc.
    - great performance, and may even have [better performace than pure file system](https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html) cache
    - portability on major platforms
- Small footprint: [176 LOC](https://coveralls.io/github/rjyo/next-boost?branch=master)
- Used in production with 300K pages cached

## How it works

`next-boost` implements a server-side cache in the manner of [stale-while-revalidate](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/). When an expired (`stale`) page is accessed, the cache will be served and at the same time, a background process will fetch the latest version (`revalidate`) of that page and save it to the cache.

There are 2 parameters to control the behavior of the cache:

- `ttl (time-to-live)`: After `ttl`, the cache will be revalidated. And a cached page's `ttl` will be updated when a page is revalidated.
- `tbd (time-before-deletion)`: When a page is not hit again in `ttl + tbd` seconds, it will be completely remove from cache.

## Drop-in replacement for Next.js

After install the package, just change the start script from `next start` to `next-boost`. All `next start`'s command line arguments, like `-p` for specifing the port, are compatible.

```
 "scripts": {
    ...
    "start": "next-boost", // previously `next start`
    ...
  },
```

## An example

```javascript
// server.js
const init = () => {
  // start your server here
  console.log('prepare and start server')
  // return the listener, a sluggish page that takes 2 seconds to render
  return (_, res) => setTimeout(() => res.end(new Date().toISOString()), 2000)
}

module.exports = { default: init }
```

```javascript
// start.js
const http = require('http')
const CachedHandler = require('next-boost').default
const script = require.resolve('./listener')
const opts = { rules: [{ regex: '.*', ttl: 1 }] }

async function start() {
  const cached = await CachedHandler({ script }, opts)
  const server = new http.Server(cached.handler)
  server.listen(3000, () => console.log(`> Server on http://localhost:3000`))
}

start()
```

You can run the example under `examples/nodejs`.

## Advanced Usages

### Deleting/Revalidating a Single URL

By sending a GET with header `x-cache-status:update` to the URL, the cache will be revalidated. And if the page doesn't exists anymore, the cache will be deleted.

    curl -H x-cache-status:update https://the_server_name.com/path_a

### Batch Deleting/Revalidating

If you want to delete mutiple pages at once, you can run SQL on the cache directly:

```bash
sqlite3 /cache_path/cache.db "update cache set ttl=0 where key like '%/url/a%';"
```

This will force all urls containing `/url/a` to be revalidated when next time accessed.

Deleting `cache_path` will remove all the caches.

### Filtering Query Parameters

By default, each page with different URLs will be cached separately. But in some cases you would like, `/path_a?utm_source=twitter` to be served with the same contents of `/path_a`. `paramFilter` is for filtering the query parameters.

```javascript
// in .next-boost.js
{
  ...
  paramFilter: (p) => p !== 'utm_source'
}
```

## All Configurable Options

If available, `.next-boost.js` at project root will be loaded. If you use next-boost programmatically, the filename can be changed in options you passed to `CachedHandler`.

The config's type is defined as below:

```typescript
interface HandlerConfig {
  filename?: string
  cache?: {
    ttl?: number
    tbd?: number
    path?: string
  }
  rules?: Array<URLCacheRule>
  paramFilter?: ParamFilter
}

interface URLCacheRule {
  regex: string
  ttl: number
}

type ParamFilter = (param: string) => boolean
```

tips: If you are using `next-boost` with Next.js directly, you may want to use the config file.

And here's an example [`.next-boost.sample.js`](https://github.com/rjyo/next-boost/blob/master/.next-boost.sample.js) in the repo.

By default, all URLs will be cached under the default rule `.*`. You can change the rules programmatically or by `.next-boost.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  rules: [
    { regex: '^/blog.*', ttl: 300 },
  ],
}
```

Above: only caching pages with URL start with `/blog`.

## Performance

By using `worker_threads`, the CPU-heavy SSR rendering will not blocking the main process from serving the cache.

Here are the comparision of using `ApacheBench` on a blog post fetched from database. HTML prerendered and the db operation takes around 10~20ms. The page takes around 200ms for Next.js to render.

```
$ /usr/local/bin/ab -n 200 -c 8 http://127.0.0.1:3000/blog/posts/2020/3/postname
```

Not a scientific benchmark, but the improvements are visibly huge.

with `next-boost`:

```

with `next start` (data fetched with `getServerSideProps`):

```

Concurrency Level:      8
Time taken for tests:   41.855 seconds
Complete requests:      200

Time per request:       209.273 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
Transfer rate:          357.58 [Kbytes/sec] received
```

It even outperforms next.js's static generated page (`getStaticProps`) with 2~2.5x requests per seconds in my environment.

## Logging

Logging is enabled by default. If you use `next-boost` programmatically, you can disable logs by passing the `debug` boolean flag as an option to `CachedHandler`.


```javascript
...
const cached = await CachedHandler({ script, args, debug: false });
...
```

## Limitations

- For architecture with multiple load-balanced rendering servers, the benefit of using `next-boost` is limited. Until the url is hit on every backend server, it can still miss the cache. Though sharing the cache on network file systems with servers might help.
- For session/cookie based pages, like user's dashboard and etc, next-boost is not a good choice as the page is updated in the background and the user might ha.
- `worker_threads` is a relatively "new" API and was added since node.js 10.5.0. `next-boost` was only tested on node.js LTS (12.x).

## FAQs

### Notice about Next.js's custom server

`next-boost` works as an in-place replacement for `next start` by using Next.js's [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server) feature.

On the linked page above, you can see the following notice:

> Before deciding to use a custom server please keep in mind that it should only be used when the integrated router of Next.js can't meet your app requirements. A custom server will remove important performance optimizations, like serverless functions and Automatic Static Optimization.

next-boost is meant to be used on cloud VPS or containers, so serverless function is not an issue here. As to `Automatic Static Optimization`, because we are not doing any `app.render` here, it still works, as perfect as always.

### Why SQLite

Here's the article about [when not to use SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html). And for next-boost's main purpuse: super faster SSR on low-cost VPSs, as far as I know, it is the best choice.
